# React + Vite

Methodology:
    We have given you a nearly completed project, but we are still missing some key components to help our webpage provide information about movies.

    When you clone the repository you need to be able to load the project and ensure the dependencies are installed.

    When scaffolding a new react project you would use the terminal to

STEP 1: Install dependencies

    navigate to the main project in your terminal "CineSearch_Demo".

    npm install
    npm i react-router-dom 
    npm i react-icons
    npm i react-bootstrap

    the command:
    npm run dev
    will start a localhost on port 5174 for you

    Shortcut: o + enter to open the browser to this port!

Step 2: Create a new component

    MovieListHeading.jsx will highlight the sections of videos to the user.

    1. Import react as a dependency;

    2. Create a function that returns valid html
        Many sections will use this heading so we will create a parameter that accepts data from a property called "heading".

        Reminder: Each element must be closed properly before returning!

    3. Export the function to be used in App.jsx

Step 3: Implement new component

    1. Import the new component
    
    2. Determine where a listing header is needed and set the heading as a property.

Step 4: Create MovieDetails.jsx
